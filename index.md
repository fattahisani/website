Moe is currently a Senior Embedded Software Engineer working in the New Product Innovation (NPI) Software Team at [Dyson](http://dyson.co.uk). He has been actively involved in a number of critical innovative projects that includes prototyping .
As a member of NST team, he is responsible for ensuring the next generation of connected products and technologies are properly explored, tested and refined in readiness to transition to the delivery teams. This includes ensuring investigating and utilising the right technologies, techniques, services and security. Core to this is exploring the proposition and technology by developing proof of concept integrations and systems.
Some key technologies include:
* IoT/Connected Systems
* Embedded Linux systems
* Bluetooth Low Energy


Prior to Dyson, Moe was a Research Associate at Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL), working on [SMARTsurg](https://smartsurg-project.eu) European project to build a more intuitive teleoperated surgical robot. During his research at BRL, he contributed to different aspects of the project including hand tracking, teleoperation, virtual reality and haptic feedback.


Moe has also worked as a Fellow at Italian Institute of Technology(IIT)'s Advanced Robotics Lab (ADVR) where he was part of a cutting edge projects called [The Robot Teleoperativo](https://advr.iit.it/projects/inail-scc/teleoperazione) project, which aims for substituting humans in hazardous environments with a quadruped robotic platform operated by an immersive virtual reality master station. Moe was a member of the user interface group where he successfully contributed to many aspects of the project including Sound Source Localisation (SSL), and telemetry aspects. He designed and implemented a novel approach in sound source position estimation which can be helpful in efficiently identifying the 3D location of the fire or earthquake accident victims by a moving robot that carries a microphone array. The outcome of this impactful research has been presented and published in the 19th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR) in Brazil. 


Before IIT, Moe was a member of R&D department at [Sobh Parlar Industrial Co](http://parlar.ir/en/). where he delivered several products in the field of household appliances.
